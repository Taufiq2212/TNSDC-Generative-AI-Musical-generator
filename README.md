# TNSDC-Generative-AI-Musical-generator
# Music Generation with LSTM

This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to generate music. The model is trained on a dataset of musical sequences and generates new compositions based on learned patterns and structures.

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of LSTM layers within a neural network to create a music generation system. The model is trained on a dataset of existing music and then used to generate new compositions by predicting subsequent musical notes or sequences.

## Architecture
The core components of the project are:
- A sequential neural network architecture using LSTM layers.
- Dense layers to process the output of the LSTM layers.
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- An Adamax optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01.
- A categorical cross-entropy loss function for training.

## Installation
To set up this project, ensure you have Python and the necessary dependencies installed. You can use the following steps to install the dependencies:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
